You certify that the information provided is true and complete and that this application is for business purposes only, not for personal, family or household use. Property. If you listed real estate, you also authorize Recipients to obtain property, title, lien, tax and valuation reports about it, and to share this application with funding partners that offer funding secured by real estate. Any such funding is a separate agreement secured by your property; if it is not repaid, you could lose the property. You certify that any funding will be used for the business purposes you stated.

If your application for business credit is denied, you have the right to a written statement of the specific reasons for the denial. To obtain the statement, contact Lamp within 60 days from the date you are notified of the decision; the statement will be sent within 30 days of receiving your request. The federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age (provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); because all or part of the applicant’s income derives from any public assistance program; or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.
